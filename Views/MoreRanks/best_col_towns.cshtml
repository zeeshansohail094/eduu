                            <p>There are a lot of things that have to click to make a truly great college town. Whether it&#8217;s feeling the palpable vibe of an alma mater, having tons to do, or the fact that your college town is a great place to stay after you&#8217;ve graduated, we&#8217;ve worked to provide you with a quality list of the best college towns in the nation.</p>
                            <p><strong>What we considered:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Livability</li>
                                <li>Student-to-resident ratio</li>
                                <li>Cultural Offerings</li>
                                <li>School Presence</li>
                                <li>Large Employers</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The towns at the top of our list have all of the above, while towns featuring only a handful of our criteria are ranked lower. As an example, 50th ranked Tacoma has high livability and large employer scores, it lacks somewhat in the other three, particularly in student-to-resident ratio and school presence. We recognize that everyone values different things in their college towns, but in an effort to establish diversity of views in the ranking of college towns, we have decided on the above criteria as a valuable way to highlight the towns that truly are a great part of our college experience, before, during, and after school.</p>

                                Home to the University of Puget Sound, City University of Seattle-Tacoma, The Evergreen State College Tacoma Campus, Pacific Lutheran University, and the University of Washington Tacoma, this college town is bustling with students. Listed as the 19th most walkable city in the nation, and one of America&#8217;s most livable areas, Tacoma has the makings of a quality college town even without a flagship institution. A light rail system also runs through town and through to Seattle. Historically, the Port of Tacoma (Washington&#8217;s largest port) has supported the city&#8217;s economy, but today a variety of employers call Tacoma home, including local Universities, state departments, healthcare providers and Boeing. The city is sometimes known as &#8220;America&#8217;s gayest city&#8221; with LGBT couples allowed to marry and a number holding political offices. Art, seafood, microbreweries, and coffee make Tacoma a joy similar to Seattle, just a bit smaller.

                                The hometown of Nike is known for outdoor opportunities, support for the arts, &#8220;alternative&#8221; lifestyles, and the University of Oregon. Eugene has lots of green space, and uncontested views of Skinner Butte and Mount Pisgah. As a politically active town with a connection to the outdoors, it&#8217;s not surprising that Eugene was home to &#8220;anarcho-primitivist&#8221; protests in the 1990&#8217;s and early 2000&#8217;s. Despite the urge of some of Eugene&#8217;s residents to return to nature, there are a number of large employers in the town, including PeaceHealth Medical Group, the University of Oregon, and the school district.

In recognition that not everyone wants to move to a small town, the city has taken many steps in recent years to retain talent and attract highly-skilled workers. The UNI incubator program has housed many up and coming tech firms, and the city is in the process of redoing many trails to enhance quality of life. Downtown is bustling with restaurants and nightlife, and the Waterloo is home to one of the largest homosexual population in Iowa; a yearly gay pride parade called the Cedar Valley Pridefest draws crowds from around the region.

                                Ithaca is a naturally beautiful, very walkable town known as the home of Cornell and Ithaca College. Though the winters are brutal, and it&#8217;s a bit isolated (4 hours from NYC, and an hour away from the nearest big city), these are also facts that foster a unique sense of community. Almost half of Ithaca&#8217;s population are students throughout the school year, and accordingly, there are tons of local student-centered gatherings and nightlife offerings. For a town it&#8217;s size, Ithaca also boasts a surprisingly talented and diverse music scene. The school of music at Ithaca College attracts a great deal of talent, and many graduates choose to stay in town after they graduate. Throw in some good brews from a number of local breweries and you&#8217;ve got a pretty awesome college town!

                                Roughly one out of two Ann Arbor residents are students during the school year, setting the stage for a college town feel. University of Michigan football games are the real center of entertainment in Ann Arbor. Outside of football season, however, there is a good mixture of modern cuisine, bars, museums, parks, and cultural offerings. Despite the frigid winter months, bike paths, trails, and good city planning make Ann Arbor quite livable. Ann Arbor has quality education from K-post grad, and boasts some of the finest elementary school music programs in the country.
