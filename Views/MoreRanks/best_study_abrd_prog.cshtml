                <h1><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1578" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/50StudyAbroad.jpg" alt="50StudyAbroad" width="800" height="400" srcset="http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/50StudyAbroad.jpg 800w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/50StudyAbroad-300x150.jpg 300w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/50StudyAbroad-600x300.jpg 600w, http://www.bestcollegereviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/50StudyAbroad-150x75.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></h1>
                <blockquote><p>“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one&#8217;s lifetime.” –Mark Twain</p></blockquote>
                <p>The world is an open door, and college students are standing on the threshold. Never before have there been more international opportunities for college students; potential employers see international experience as a qualification in hiring college graduates. Not only is studying abroad beneficial to one’s resume, traveling broadens the mind, grows compassion, and allows the person to see the world through a new lens.</p>
                <p>With the vast expanse of study abroad programs available at almost every university, here at Best College Reviews we compiled a list of some of the most desirable study abroad opportunities. We found that most universities offer study abroad programs through third-party organizations, or they provide enrollment at a partner university in a foreign country, but our list contains programs unique to the university, and provide a personal experience for the student. Our list was chosen based on the following criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The program is open to a limited number of students, 500 or less, providing a more intimate experience while abroad.</li>
                    <li>The program is at least a semester long.</li>
                    <li>Faculty from the university are involved with the students internationally, either traveling with the students, teaching abroad, or overseeing the program in the country.</li>
                    <li>The university has a specific location internationally, students are not simply enrolling at international universities.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>1. University of Evansville</h2>
